# MobPay - An iOS library for integrating card and mobile payments through Interswitch

This Pod enables you to integrate Interswitch payments to your mobile app

## Adding MobpayiOS to a project

## CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Mobpay into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
To get the library add the following dependency to your podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MobpayiOS'
```

Then run the following command
``` shell
pod install
```

Don't forget to use the .xcworkspace file to open your project in Xcode, instead of the .xcodeproj file, from here on out.

In the future, to update to the latest version of the SDK, just run:

```shell
pod update MobpayiOS
```

## Usage examples

Get an interswitch client Id and client secret for your interswitch merchant account then instantiate a mobpay object by doing the following:

```swift

import MobpayiOS


let card = Card(pan: "4111111111111111", cvv: "123", expiryYear: "20", expiryMonth: "02", tokenize: false)
let payment = Payment(amount: "100", transactionRef: "66809285644", orderId: "OID123453", terminalType: "MOBILE", terminalId: "3TLP0001", paymentItem: "CRD", currency: "KES")
let customer = Customer(customerId: "12", firstName: "Allan", secondName: "Mageto", email: "test@gmail.com", mobile: "0712345678", city: "NBI", country: "KE", postalCode: "00200", street: "WESTLANDS", state: "NBI")
let merchant = Merchant(merchantId: "your merchant id", domain: "your domain")             
                    
try!Mobpay.instance.makeCardPayment(card: card, merchant: merchant, payment: payment, customer: customer, clientId: self.clientId,clientSecret: self.clientSecret){ (completion) in showResponse(message: completion)
}
```

## Migrating from version 0.1.0 to 0.2.0
### Why should one migrate?

There are two new functions ðŸ¥³ 
1. Submit with token

```ruby
 try!Mobpay.instance.makeCardTokenPayment(cardToken: cardToken, merchant: merchantInput, payment: paymentInput, customer: customerInput, clientId: self.clientId,clientSecret: self.clientSecret){ (completion) in showResponse(message: completion)
                    }
```
2. Confirm mobile money payment
```ruby
try!Mobpay.instance.confirmMobileMoneyPayment(orderId: self.orderId, clientId: self.clientId,clientSecret: self.clientSecret){ (completion) in showResponse(message: completion)}
```

## Migration steps
1. In your .podspec file

Change 
```ruby
pod 'mobpay', :git => 'https://github.com/interswitch-kenya-limited/mobpay-ios-lib.git'
```

to

```ruby
pod 'MobpayiOS'
```

then run
```shell
pod install
```
That should remove the old library and install the new one

On your code instead of importing

```swift
import mobpay
```

do 

```swift
import MobpayiOS
```
